### moonmask editor

This is a project using django/python on the backend and ember.js on the
frontend. It's a simplified & more sophisticated version of an earlier project
I have, mun fase editor.

## source

I built the base of this project by following (Michael X's Django  EmberJS
tutorial)[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/eli5-full-stack-basics-breakthrough-with-django-emberjs-402fc7af0e3]
